## DynamoDB Design

### 1. MessageDoc Table
#### Table Name: Messages
This table stores all the messages exchanged between users (like therapists and clients or it can be clients and clients or therapists and therapists ).  
Attributes:
- `message_id` (string, Primary Key – unique for each message)
- `sender` (string, sender of the message)
- `receiver` (string, receiver of the message)
- `content` (string, the actual message text)
- `timestamp` (string, used as a Sort Key for ordering messages)

GSI:
- `receiver-timestamp-index`
  - Hash Key: `receiver`
  - Range Key: `timestamp`

This index helps fetch all messages sent to a specific receiver in chronological order( like based on timestamp , it can help us to create a chat in frontend).

Example Queries:
- Get all messages for a specific receiver (e.g., a therapist):  
  Query: receiver = 'therapist123' AND sort by timestamp  
  Index Used: receiver-timestamp-index

### 2. ClientDoc Table
#### Table Name: Clients
This table stores information about the clients.  
Attributes:
- `client_id` (string, Primary Key)
- `email` (string, client's email)
- `name` (string, client’s name)
- `phone` (string, phone number)
- `address` (string, home address)
- `dob` (string, date of birth)
- `therapist_ids` (List of strings, therapists associated with the client)

GSI:
- `email-index`
  - Hash Key: `email`

This index allows you to look up clients by their email, which is useful for authentication and fetching profile details.Like user can login through email and password , and after successful authentication, we can fetch user details through email

Example Queries:
- Fetch client info by their email:  
  Query: email = 'client@example.com'  
  Index Used: email-index

### 3. TherapistDoc Table
#### Table Name: Therapists
This table stores details of therapists registered on the platform.  
Attributes:
- `therapist_id` (string, Primary Key)
- `email` (string, therapist’s email)
- `first_name` (string, therapist's first name)
- `last_name` (string, therapist's last name)
- `specialization` (string, area of expertise)
- `created_at` (string, date the therapist joined the platform)
-'address' (string, address of the therapist)

- `client_ids` (List of strings, clients associated with the therapist)

GSI:
- `email-index`
  - Hash Key: `email`
- `specialization-createdAt-index`
  - Hash Key: `specialization`
  - Range Key: `created_at`
 -'address-index'
 Hash Key: address
  Range Key: created_at

These indices help you find therapists by email or search by their specialization,address while sorting results by join date.

Example Queries:
- Find therapists by specialization:  
  Query: specialization = 'Cognitive Therapy' AND sort by created_at  
  Index Used: specialization-createdAt-index  

---

### 4. JournalDoc Table
#### Table Name: Journals
This table tracks client journals.  
Attributes:
- `journal_id` (string, Primary Key)
- `client_id` (string, ID of the client who created the journal)
- `emotion` (string, emotional state logged in the journal)
- `feeling` (string, detailed feelings)
- `intensity` (number, how intense the emotion is)
- `notes` (string, optional notes from the client)
- `timestamp` (string, Sort Key, time the journal was created)

GSI:
- `client-timestamp-index`
  - Hash Key: `client_id`
  - Range Key: `timestamp`
- `emotion-intensity-index`
  - Hash Key: `emotion`
  - Range Key: `intensity`

These indices allow journals to be retrieved by client and timestamp or analyzed by emotion sorted by intensity.

Example Queries:
- Retrieve journals for a specific client:  
  Query: client_id = 'client123' AND sort by timestamp  
  Index Used: client-timestamp-index  
- Analyze journals by emotion:  
  Query: emotion = 'Happiness' AND sort by intensity  
  Index Used: emotion-intensity-index

### 5. RequestDoc Table
#### Table Name: Requests
This table tracks various requests (e.g., journal access, therapist access).

- `from` (string, ID of the sender)
- `to` (string, ID of the receiver)
- `message` (string, message content of the request)

 GSI:

from-type-index
Hash Key: from
Range Key: created_at

to-type-index
Hash Key: to
Range Key: type
These indices allow requests to be filtered by sender, receiver, or type

Example Queries:
Query: from = 'client123' AND type = 'Journal'  
 
GSI Used: from-type-index  and similar for to index also like journal access request sent to a particular client
